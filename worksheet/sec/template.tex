\section{Introduction}
Start with a short introduction that describes the topic and aim of the report. This should not be longer than 200 words.
Style and format
Write the report in English and write max 8 pages (excluding references, title page and appendix). Use size 11 Times New Roman, 1.5 line spacing; non-justified body text; indent 1.5 cm each paragraph new paragraph. Ensure pages are numbered and name on each page. Each page should contain an average of between 350 and 400 words approximately. Do not use images/pictures in the body text but rather as an appendix with clear cross reference.
Use any editor you like, Word, LaTeX or other. The important thing is that your report addresses and discusses the topic in a clear, structured way with a clear red thread, and that you cite any sources used in the proper fashion in line with APA style and format. It should be easy for the reader to see that you have included the information needed and fulfilled the course objectives (check the course description on Moodle).
\section{Headings}
Structure the report in a sensible way and use headings and subheadings named in a sensible way to guide the reader. The headings and subheadings can be numbered or of different size (as in this document).
Subheadings
By using subheadings and headings it becomes easy to relate the information in different paragraphs and sections to each other
\section{Theory}
Report the theory relevant to your topic and the questions you are addressing. The selected course literatures are good starting points, but you should also search for, read and review articles, and other relevant information. The (majority of) theories, must be relevant to the course and study plan â€“ this being a way to show your knowledge in the course and give the reader background information in order to understand your research.

If you have any questions regarding your report, please contact courses lecturer in reasonable time before hand in. The weekend of delivery is NOT reasonable.

\section{Referencing style}
Use the APA (American Psychology Association) referencing style for referencing as done in this document and described in guides by Paiz et al (2013) \url{https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/}.

You need to cite ALL sources that you have been using. A reader must be able to tell whether any statement is your own or from some other source. If you copy paste from a text it should appear as a quote (in ) and with the reference clearly stated. If in doubt, please check the book by Pears and Shields (2013) how to do this properly. The sources of any images you include from webpages etc also need to be properly cited and listed at the end.  
Plagiarism
Using text or material from another source without properly citing the original author is considered plagiarism. We check your reports using Ephorus and any plagiarism will lead to a failed grade and will be reported. Report of plagiarism is a very serious thing indeed, leading to suspension from studies (see \url{http://www.plagiarism.aau.dk/}).

\section{Own experiments}
Describe the methods used and discuss the results in relation to theory. 
Methods
Own methods should be described briefly, but in detail.
Participants
Procedure
Results
Present the results that came out of the experiment, perhaps using a graph or table. Refer to the table or graph in the text, describing what it shows. This section should be short and concise and take up maximum 1 page.
Discussion
\section{Summary and Conclusion}
End with a short summary and conclusion in relation to the information you have chosen to present in your report.

\section{Hand-in}
Hand in your finished report as pdf in two places:
The assignment on Moodle
On \url{https://www1.ephorus.com/students/handin_us}  (using a hand-in code provided by your teacher).
Your reported must be uploaded by Nov 22 12.00 (noon).

Overall: Be aware of typical errors especially repeats in text; not being specific to differentiate content to fit a section (and only that section) e.g. one section contents included in another section beyond what is acceptable.
Remember there is no such thing as good writing, only good re-writing.
