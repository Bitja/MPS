\textbf{Interview notes:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Subject B: didnâ€™t go well, a bit difficult the last one to trace back to the line, that was annoying, went back to the green light and was not even half way through the level.
\item Subject A: had some difficulties understanding 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{After revealing the test purpose:}
\begin{itemize}
\item It made more sense for Subject B, she tried everything, right until there was only two seconds left.
\end{itemize}
