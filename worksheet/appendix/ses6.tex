Note: The battery of the tablet was low, which caused an interference from test conductors in the tutorial of Subject A.

\textbf{Interview notes:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Subject A: “second player advantage”, quick to finish a level, he didn’t see the first line, though he had to drag the green circle to the red one. 
\item Subject B: the green light feedback is uneven, tried to go back to the line, too little time, looked mostly on the light as a scale.
\item Subject A: too much time in the levels, he used the light when he found the line.
\item Subject A claims that B was evil, she had the right to taunt him, because she won. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{After revealing the test purpose:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Subject B: so that is why, very annoying, angry, wondered why she couldn’t find it.
\item Subject A: thought level 2 was broken.
\end{itemize}
