\textbf{Interview notes: }
\begin{itemize}
\item Subject B: difficult at the end, it was completely red, used a combination of different methods, mostly moving back.
\item Otherwise it was straightforward, 
\item They use few words in the interview.
\item Light: “Where the fuck am I?”, bigger than the side
\item Not mean to each other, they laugh, they played more seperately. 
\item Suggest to give visual feedback after the level to see the path drawn by the user.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{After revealing the test purpose:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Subject A expressed it was frustrating
\item Subject B confirms it didn’t go well, being a bit quiet, it has to be more difficult in order to get mad (implying that she needs to invest more of herself, before experience it negatively)
\end{itemize}
